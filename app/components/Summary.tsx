            <p>Sir Vincent Floribund was many things: a Keymaster Reaper, an avid gardener, a leader of his community, a researcher, and your grandfather. Two years after he vanishes, you are summoned to his estate to execute his will. Pulled into the strange and spooky town of Hallowed Crossing, the keys to the mysterious circumstances of his disappearance lie in recultivating his extensive gardens.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Grow crops, keep creatures, and freely decorate more than nine uniquely themed farmable maps.</p>
            <p>Explore the canyon's miasma-filled caves and wander through the maze-like forest of the fae.</p>
            <p>Deepen your bonds with the town's inhabitants- particularly the spacey witch's daughter Sparrow, the geeky aspiring author Petya, and the prickly lone wolf Lazarus. Choosing to romance them will unlock additional dialogue, while remaining friends still allows you to progress their storylines.</p>
